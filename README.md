This is my capstone project. In progress.
Right now it is in Phase 1 only, where I have implemented a fact extractor, fact verifier against an established database (Wikipedia in this case, for the time being) and a contradiction checker.
I have also implemented sessions and session history.
Next up would be digression mapper and updating the fact extractor and verifier to ignore spurious facts. Moreover, a more robust and sophisticated verifier needs to be put into place.

In the meantime, you can access the app here :
